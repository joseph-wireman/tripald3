Tripal d3.js API
==================

Provides d3.js integration for Tripal. It provides an API for developing consistent biological diagrams with a common configuration, as well as, providing some common diagrams such as pie, bar, column, histogram and pedigree diagrams.

NOTE: This module is an API and does not provide user facing diagrams. Rather, you would use this API to easily draw common diagrams within your own fields. For an example of how to use this module, see Tripal Fancy Fields.
